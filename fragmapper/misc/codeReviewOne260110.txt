Yep — I reviewed the zip. Overall it’s a strong starting structure (docs/specs + rules YAML + router/skills + tests). The main gaps are about single-source-of-truth alignment and a few repo hygiene / packaging issues.

Below are the changes I’d make (ordered by impact).

What’s already solid

Clear separation of router vs skill modules (src/fragmapper/router.py, src/fragmapper/agents/*)

Specs captured as docs (docs/FragMapper_Router.md, docs/ParfumoMapper.md, etc.)

A rules-as-data file exists (configs/fragmapper_rules.yml)

You’ve got a “golden cases” concept (tests/cases.json) and unit tests for output formatting

This is the right skeleton for staying sane long-term.



ISSUE 1) Broken CLI entrypoint

pyproject.toml declares:

[project.scripts]
fragmapper = "fragmapper.cli:main"


…but there is no src/fragmapper/cli.py.

✅ Either:

add cli.py, or

remove the script entry until you need it

(Leaving it as-is will confuse future-you the first time you try to run it.)

Testing alignment (what you have vs what you need)
ISSUE 2) Golden test set is aspirational but not enforceable yet

tests/cases.json expects many MATCH results, but the actual ParfumoMapper implementation is explicitly a placeholder and will usually return NO_MATCH because brand/name extraction is not implemented.

✅ Recommendation:
Split tests into two categories:

Contract tests (always true right now)

to_simple_output() formatting

router dispatch

“no extra output” rules

Golden behavior tests (manual/UI regression for now)

keep tests/cases.json but treat it as “UI regression pack” until you actually implement search + scoring in code

This avoids a false sense of “tests pass therefore mapping works”.

UI-first alignment recommendation

Since you said you’re using the ChatGPT UI first, the Python repo should mainly do:

versioning of docs/YAML

linting for contradictions

regression case management

packaging a “copy/paste bundle” of project files

A very practical improvement:

ISSUE 3) Add a “Project Bundle” folder that matches your ChatGPT Project file names

Right now your authoritative files are in docs/ + configs/. Your ChatGPT Project likely wants:

FragMapper_Router.md

ParfumoMapper.md

fragmapper_rules.yml

(plus placeholders)

✅ Recommendation:
Create project_files/ (or dist/project_files/) containing exactly the files you paste into ChatGPT Projects, with the exact names/paths you expect there.

That reduces human error when syncing.
