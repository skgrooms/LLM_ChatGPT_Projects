  principles:
    - "Prefer correctness over guessing."
    - "Output must be extremely simple and usable without further parsing."
    - "Do not include explanations unless required by output contract."
    - "Prefer returning AMBIGUOUS over asking questions."
    - "Use web browsing when mapping (search and confirm target page)."

      - "If concentration is specified and Parfumo has separate pages, match the correct one."
      - "If flanker/edition is clearly indicated, do not map to base."
      - "If evidence is vague and multiple candidates fit, return AMBIGUOUS."
